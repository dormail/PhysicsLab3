\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The measurements were unsuccessful and have room for improvement.

It is very likely that the samples have been touched with the bare hands throughout the semester or
collected other dirt particles,
leading to imperfections on the surface. A cleaner sample can lead to good results, however one
needs to make sure that the surface does not get damaged, i.e. NaCl can dissolve if the liquid cleaner is
hydrophilic.

Another source of error can be a low quality x-ray source, which can happen when the electrodes
inside desintegrate over time.

On the positive side, the automized angular setting and measurement was helpful and allowed for
efficient measurements.

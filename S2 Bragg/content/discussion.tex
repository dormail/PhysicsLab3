\section{Discussion}

Overall the measurement yielded rather unfruitful results. Already the NaCl measurement runs where
not very clean and it was not possible to distinguish different lines like the $K_\alpha$ and
$K_\beta$ line. 

Our result $\lambda_2 = \SI{63.92}{pm}$ shows a small error from the given value $K_\beta =
\SI{63.09}{pm}$
spectral line, but $\lambda_1 = \SI{54.05}{pm}$ is far off from both relevant spectral lines.

The results we got for lattice constants for both LiF and Ti shows a key problem: Since we have
unclean data, we can not even compute exact values for the lattice constants since it is unclear if
our measured peak comes from the $K_\alpha$ or $K_\beta$ spectrum. Secondly, are all given values
far of from the values stated in the manual, by at least $10\%$.

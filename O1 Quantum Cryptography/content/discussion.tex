As it can be seen in \autoref{eqn:final_message}, the transmission failed due to the eavesdropper,
who could not succesfully guess the bases for the bits. The initial message ``KAIST`` was received
as ``YCSSC``. 

In total 15 bits were altered, leading to an error rate of $60\%$. This corresponds to
an exceptionally bad transmission through the eavesdropper, as by random guessing $50\%$ would be
the epectation value.

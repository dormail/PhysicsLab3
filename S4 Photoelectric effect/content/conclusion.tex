\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
While we did measure a photo current, the scope of this work was limited and the results are
lacking.

When setting up the apparatus, experimentalists should give caution to correct handling and stay
cautious about the linear behiour we observed. 

To further test the predictions made in \autoref{sec:intr:photoeffect}, one can use light with 
different wave lengths. Furthermore, different materials for sample and collector can be used, since
their energy structure and different binding energies can also lead to new results.

Eventhough it was a challenge to get a laser resonance and suport from the TA was needed, in the end
we managed to get a good quality laser. The cavity length of $\SI{135}{cm}$ is close to the
theoretical limit of $\SI{140}{cm}$, which was noticeable by the instabillity when turning the
adjustment screws of the mirrors.

The measurement of the spectrum went good afterwards, and we got a very clean peak at
\[
  \lambda = \SI{634}{nm}
\]
which is very close to the textbook value $\lambda^\text{lit} = \SI{632.8}{nm}$
\cite{ABRAMCZYK200559}.

Rather unexplainable is the decrease in intensity when increasing the current of the tube. Other
groups in the lab got the same result, but until the time of writing this report we found no
explanation for this behavior.

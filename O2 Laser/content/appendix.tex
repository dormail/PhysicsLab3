\section{Cleaning the spectrum}
\label{sec:cleaning}
To clean the spectral measurement from background noise, such as light or digital displays used, we
introduced a noise cancelling inspired approach, where we performed the same measurement with and
without tha He-Ne power supply turned on. It is important to not move the spectrometer in between
the measurements. 

The two signals can then be subtracted from each other, as it is shown in \autoref{fig:cleaning}.
Afterwards the signal can be normalized.

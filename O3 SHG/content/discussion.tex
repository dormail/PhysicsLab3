\section{Discussion}

The ratio between the frequency peaks mentioned in \autoref{eqn:ratio} has a deviation of $0.2\%$
from a perfect frequency doubling.

Eventhough the result is close to the theoretical expectation, there have been many sources of
error which can lead to bad results. A perfect SHG has only be achieved after careful setup and
fine-tuning of the optical elements; small deviations can destroy the result altogether.

Apart from that, the rail and good quality of the elements made the procedure as stable as it was
for us.

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Several approaches for surface-sensitive conductance measurements are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on nanoscale multi-point probe techniques. The results for two model systems, which have given rise to some dispute, are discussed in detail: Si(111)(7 × 7) and ()Ag–Si(111). Other recent examples are also given, such as phase transitions in quasi-one-dimensional structures on semiconductor surfaces and the surface sheet conductivity of Bi(111), the surface of a semimetal.}

Diffused surface layers can be treated as two-dimensional structures, but the factors are also useful in obtaining body resistivities on thin samples.},

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Eventhough the Meissner-Ochsenberg effect has not been observed on our sample, the quantitative
result of low electrical resistance below $\SI{83.729}{K}$ is a sign of a working superconductor.

The results can be imporved by being more cautious when producing the sample as the critical
behaviour and optimal (i.e. high) critical temperature depend on exact ratios between the elements.

With better attachment of the probes the overall measurement of electrical resistance can be
improved. This can be achieved by training the experimental workers in the field, e.g. in hot and
cold soldering techniques.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
As shown in the last section, we were able to reproduce the qualtitive nature of the Hall effect,
but for small currents or magnetic fields the analysis becomes hard due to noise. 

Improvements are possible by reducing the sources of error mentioned in the discussion. Moreover,
the setup can be improved by having three inputs, such that sample current, Hall voltage and
magnetic field can be measured altogether. 

The recording with a software turned out to be a good
feature and made the linear regression more stable, due to the abundance of data point. A source for
error is the start and end however, since the are many point for the minimum and maximum. This leads
to a bias in the regression and artificially lowers the uncertainty.

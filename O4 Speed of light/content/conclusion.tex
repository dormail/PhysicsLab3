\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This work found the speed of light in air and synthetic resin as
\begin{align}
  c_\text{Air} &= (2.97 \pm 0.04) 10^8 \, \si{m/s} \\
  c_\text{resin} &= (1.9 \pm 0.1) \cdot 10^8 \, \si{ms^{-1}},
\end{align}
the overall deviation from the known values taken from literature and experimental manual are less
or equal to $1.6\%$. The literature values lie within the boundries of uncertainty and for the
largest uncertainties the sources have been identiefied to be a low-quality probe and problems in
the experimental setup.
